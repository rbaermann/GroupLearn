# GroupLearn
GroupLearn is a web application that allows students from any education level to create study groups. The database will only
display groups to the user that are in his/her school. Any user can create a study group, and the creater will automaticaly become
the group leader. We built a 5 star rating system that allows members of the study group to rate their study leader. This
allows for members of future study groups to see the quality of study sessions that this group leader organizes. 

Shortly we will have the google API in the application so the user can see exactly where the study session is being held.
